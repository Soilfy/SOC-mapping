# Soilify SOC Scripts

This repository contains scripts written for the **Soilify SOC Project**. The scripts are developed using Python and JavaScript, and they utilize various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

## Data Preparation Script

The data preparation script is named `soc_data_prep.ipynb`. This Jupyter notebook contains code for cleaning and preprocessing raw data. It reads the raw data from a CSV file, performs data cleaning and preprocessing, and saves the cleaned data to a new CSV file. The notebook also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to help gain insights into the data.

## Modeling Script

The modeling script is named `soc_models.ipynb`. This Jupyter notebook contains code for building and evaluating machine learning models. It reads the cleaned data from the CSV file generated by the data preparation script, splits the data into training and testing sets, and trains various machine learning models on the training data. The notebook then evaluates the performance of the models on the testing data and selects the best model based on evaluation metrics.
