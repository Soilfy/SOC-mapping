# **Soilify SOC Scripts**

This repository contains the scripts written for **Solify SOC Project**. The scripts are written in Python and JavaScript and use various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

## **Data Preparation Script**

The data preparation script is called `soc_data_prep.ipynb`. This notebook contains the code for cleaning and preprocessing the raw data. The notebook reads in the raw data from a CSV file, performs data cleaning and preprocessing, and saves the cleaned data to a new CSV file. The notebook also includes some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to help understand the data.

## **Modeling Script**

The modelling script is called `soc_models.ipynb`. This notebook contains the code for building and evaluating the machine learning models. The notebook reads in the cleaned data from the CSV file generated by the data preparation script, splits the data into training and testing sets, and trains several machine learning models on the training data. The notebook then evaluates the performance of the models on the testing data and selects the best model based on the evaluation metrics.
