# Soilify SOC Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts for the **Soilify SOC Project**. These scripts are developed in Python, JavaScript, and Jupyter notebooks and use various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

## Training Data Extraction Script

### **Script Description**

The `training_data_extraction.js` script extracts training data for the Soilify project. This script reads satellite images from the Google Earth Engine API, processes the images to extract relevant features, and generates a dataset of labeled samples for training the machine learning models.

The script is organized into the following sections:

- **Data Loading**: Contains code for loading the satellite images from the Google Earth Engine API.
- **Data Processing**: Includes code for processing the satellite images to extract relevant features.
- **Data Labeling**: Provides code for labeling the samples based on ground truth data.
- **Data Exporting**: Contains code for exporting the labeled samples to a CSV file.

The script exports the labeled samples to a CSV file that can be used for training machine learning models.

## Data Preparation Script

The data preparation script is called `soc_data_prep.ipynb`. This Jupyter notebook contains code for cleaning and preprocessing raw data. It reads the raw data from a CSV file, performs data cleaning and preprocessing, and saves the cleaned data to a new CSV file. The notebook also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to help gain insights into the data.

## Modeling Script

The modeling script is named `soc_models.ipynb`. This Jupyter notebook contains code for building and evaluating machine learning models. It reads the cleaned data from the CSV file generated by the data preparation script, splits the data into training and testing sets, and trains various machine learning models on the training data. The notebook then evaluates the performance of the models on the testing data and selects the best model based on evaluation metrics.

### Notebooks Description
